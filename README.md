# Air_Flow_Sensor
# Objective
The objective of an air flow sensor is to measure the rate of airflow in a system, providing data to optimize ventilation, air quality control, and energy efficiency in applications such as HVAC systems, industrial processes, and automotive engines.
# Tools & technologies
ARDUINO UNO R3  
JUMPER WIRES  
MQ-2  
MQ-4  
BUZZER  
IR SENSOR  
HX710B  
EXHAUST FAN  
# Working Principle
- Thermal Conductivity Principle: In this method, the sensor measures changes in the heat transfer from a heated element as air passes over it. The flow rate is inferred from how much heat is carried away by the moving air.  
- Differential Pressure Principle: Here, the sensor measures the pressure difference across an obstruction (like a venturi or orifice) in the airflow path. The pressure difference is proportional to the flow rate of the air.
# Constrction
•	Connect the VCC pins of both sensors to the 5V pin of the Arduino.
•	Connect the GND pins to the GND of the Arduino.
•	Connect the analog output pins (A0 for MQ2 and A1 for MQ4) to the analog pins on the Arduino (e.g., A0 and A1). •  
•	Connect the load cell wires to the HX710B according to the wiring diagram (usually red to E+, black to E-, white to A+, and green to A-).
• Connect the HX710B to the Arduino 
•	Connect one terminal of the buzzer to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., D4).
•	Connect the other terminal to GND.
•	Open the Arduino IDE and go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.(HX710B, MQ series) 
•	Power up the Arduino and monitor the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the readings from the sensors.
•	Trigger the buzzer by simulating conditions that exceed the threshold values.
# Output
It is typically an electrical signal (analog or digital) that corresponds to the measured air flow rate, which can be used for monitoring or controlling systems like HVAC, engines, or industrial processes.
# Future Improvements
It include enhanced sensitivity for detecting lower flow rates, integration with IoT for real-time remote monitoring, reduced power consumption for energy efficiency, and the use of advanced materials for greater durability and accuracy in harsh environments.
# Applications
HVAC systems for air quality control, automotive engines for monitoring intake airflow, industrial ventilation systems, respiratory devices for medical purposes, and environmental monitoring for detecting air pollution.
